"""
You have to print the largest power of 2 less than or equal to n.

For example, for 10 the largest power of 2 less than or equal to 10 is 8. For 64 largest power of 2 less than or equal to it is 64

Hint: instead of the default increment in your loops, can you think of a different operator?

Example Input: 1
Output: 1
Example Input: 5
Output: 4
Example Input: 10000
Output: 8192

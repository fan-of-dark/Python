 Approach:
 A trailing zero is always produced by prime factors 2 and 5,We can easily observe that the number of 2s in prime factors is always more than or equal to the number of 5s.
 so, its enough to power of 5 in prime factorization of given number.
 for ex: for 100!, [5,10,15,20,25.......100] will produce zeroes
 we can observe multiples of 5  produce 1 zero,multiples of 25 will produce an extra zero(besides 5),multiples of 125 will produce 1 extra zeroes(besides 5 ,25) ... so on.
 so, we need to find number of 5 multiples,25 multiples, 125 multiples so on.....in [1,N](inclusive)
 CONCEPT: Number1// Number2 is equal to number of Multiples of Number2 in [1,Number1]
 
 so solution is n//5 + n//25 + n//125 + ......
 
 Solution:
 for example n = 100
 initialize count to 0
 iteration-1:
 find number of multiples of 5 in [1,100] i.e 100//5 and update n --> 20 and count-->20
 iteration-2:
 find number of multiples of 5 in [1,20] which is equal to number of 25 multiples in [5,100]
 update n--> 4,count --> 24
 iteration-3:
 find number of multiples of 5 in [1,4] which is equal to multiples of 125 in [25,100], so loop breaks.
 
 print the count.
